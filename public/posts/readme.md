# What is this folder?

This folder is where all the posts will be published, each on it's own folder.

Every file here is to be served as a static file.

## Posts

Every post should have a single markdown file containing all of it's content.

Both the folder and markdown file should have the same name as the post slug.

Example: <http://ip_address:port/posts/post_slug/post_slug.md>

## Post Content

All the files relative to the post should be included on subfolders, to make it easier to maintain.

Example: <http://ip_address:port/posts/post_slug/images/image1.png>
