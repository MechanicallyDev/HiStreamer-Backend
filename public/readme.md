# How the file structure works

Every file here is to be served as a static file.

You can't access the list of contents of a folder, only the contents itself.

## Posts

Every post should be saved into the /posts folder, followed by a folder named after the slug.

All the files relative to the post should be included on subfolders, to make it easier to maintain.

Example:

<http://ip_address:port/posts/post_slug/post_slug.md>

<http://ip_address:port/posts/post_slug/images/image1.png>
